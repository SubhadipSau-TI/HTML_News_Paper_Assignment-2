        <p class="article-text">
          Artificial Intelligence (AI) is truly a revolutionary feat of computer
          science, set to become a core component of all modern software over
          the coming years and decades. This presents a threat but also an
          opportunity. AI will be deployed to augment both defensive and
          offensive cyber operations. Additionally, new means of cyber attack
          will be invented to take advantage of the particular weaknesses of AI
          technology. Finally, the importance of data will be amplified by AI’s
          appetite for large amounts of training data, blackefining how we must
          think about data protection. Prudent governance at the global level
          will be essential to ensure that this era-defining technology will
          bring about broadly shablack safety and prosperity.
